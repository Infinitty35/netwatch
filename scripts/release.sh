# Bumps Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock, the RPM spec's Version and %changelog, and
# renames CHANGELOG.md's `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] - <today>`. Then it
# runs `cargo test`, commits "release: netwatch vX.Y.Z — <summary>" and makes
# the annotated tag. It pushes nothing; the push commands are printed at the
# end. The release workflow (scripts/release-guard.sh) refuses a tag that
# disagrees with Cargo.toml or has no CHANGELOG heading, and waits for CI to
# pass on the tagged commit.
#
# Refuses to start on a dirty tree, a detached HEAD, a branch other than
# `main` or `release/X.Y.Z`, a branch behind origin's branch of the same name,
# a tag that already exists, a version not above the current one, an
# `[Unreleased]` with no notes, or no git user.name and user.email for the
# RPM %changelog entry.
#
# package.nix is not touched: it is still at 0.26.1, and should be bumped by
# someone who can check that it builds with nix.
