//! Pluggable graph rendering for every chart in the app.
//!
//! Mirrors the theme module: a `GraphStyle` enum with a small `by_name` lookup,
//! plus a `render` entry point (and `render_with_max` for shared-axis overlays)
//! that dispatches to a per-style implementation. Every sparkline in the UI —
//! aggregated RX/TX, in-row top-connection lines, RTT history, timeline
//! severity layers, etc. — routes through here so a single setting toggles
//! them all.
//!
//! `GraphOpts.fade` enables the magnitude gradient: every cell is coloured by
//! how high it sits in the plot. Call
//! sites build the opts from `App::graph_opts()` so a single config toggle
//! governs the entire UI.
//!
//! [`area_graph`] is the one braille renderer. `GraphStyle::Dots` is it, the
//! Dense view's mirrored plot is it with `flip`, and the Dashboard's
//! throughput graph is two of them sharing a scale — so no two graphs in the
//! tool can drift apart in texture or in colour.
