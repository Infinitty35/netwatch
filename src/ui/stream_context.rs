//! What a packet's conversation is doing, and where the packet sits in it.
//!
//! The stream panel used to say `42 packets · 184 KB · 24ms handshake` and
//! stop. That is a fact about the flow, not context for the packet you have
//! selected: it does not say whether you are looking at the handshake or the
//! teardown, which end spoke, what this particular packet is *for*, or what
//! happened either side of it. An operator selecting a packet mid-capture is
//! asking "what is going on here", and the honest answer is a sequence.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of the stream, the capture and the
//! selected id — no `App`, no `Frame`. That is deliberate: `ui::packets`
//! cannot be rendered in a test because it takes `&App`, so the substance
//! lives here where it can be.
