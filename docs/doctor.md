# Doctor and capability reporting

Run a read-only setup report before starting the interactive UI or daemon:

```sh
netwatch doctor
netwatch doctor --json
```

From a source checkout, use `cargo run -- doctor --json`. The first `--` ends
Cargo's options and passes the remaining arguments to Netwatch.

Static doctor reads configuration and local setup facts. It does not start
collectors, open capture, send probes, contact configured endpoints, inspect or
recover journals, create state directories, or save configuration. On Windows it
checks standard Npcap DLL locations before any Npcap initialization. A dynamically
linked build still requires its loader dependencies to start the executable.

Missing or malformed configuration is reported explicitly; malformed content and
configured endpoint credentials are not echoed. Configuration defaults are used
where needed to describe the remaining checks. An enabled feature is not evidence
that its backend works.

## Optional capture check

```sh
netwatch doctor --check-capture
netwatch doctor --json --check-capture --interface eth0
```

The optional check selects the configured interface, or uses live interface
selection when none is configured. `--interface` overrides that selection. It
opens and configures capture using the configured BPF filter, then closes it
without reading packets. This can require capture permissions and temporarily
enable promiscuous capture, following the normal capture path.

The parent gives the isolated check process five seconds to finish, then kills
and reaps it on timeout. The check reports sandbox enforcement for that process
only. It does not prove enforcement in live workers, successful packet delivery,
process attribution or network health. No active probes or cloud calls are made.
Platform interface discovery may invoke local system helpers.

## Output contract

JSON uses `schema_version: 1`, a `scope` (`static` or `capture_check`), `platform`,
selected `interface`, `capabilities`, `protections` and `network_restricted`.
The additive `attribution_coverage` field is null in doctor reports; only runtime
snapshots contain observed coverage. See [attribution evidence](attribution.md).
Each capability has an `id`, `state`, machine-readable `reason`, explanatory
`detail` and optional `next_check`. States are `ready`, `not_checked`,
`unavailable`, `disabled`, `degraded` and `stale`. Consumers should tolerate new
capabilities and reason codes. A report is a point-in-time observation.

A completed diagnostic report exits successfully even when capabilities are
unavailable. Inspect states in JSON to enforce your own requirements. Invalid CLI
arguments or a fatal command error exit unsuccessfully. Plain text is wrapped for
an 80-column terminal and does not depend on color.

Live startup and Settings use the same model with actual capture, attribution,
probe completion, TCP freshness and component protection observations. A separate
doctor process cannot inspect that live process; its report describes setup or
its own isolated capture check. Neither a ready capture backend nor completed
probes imply a healthy network. Network containment is not provided.

## Verification scope

Linux automated coverage includes CLI validation, serialization, narrow-terminal
text, subprocess timeout cleanup, unavailable interfaces, malformed config,
configured endpoint traps and unchanged recovery/configuration files. These tests
do not establish privileged capture success or macOS/Windows runtime parity.
